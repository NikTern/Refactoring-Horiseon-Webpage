# <Horiseon  Homework task>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code of the Horiseon website so that it is more accessible. Alt-text was added to images, and the code was consolidated, re-ordered more logically and streamlined where possible.

I learned the value of using a single CSS selector to target multiple elements to achieve readability and simplicity, rather than having the same code appear multiple times.
